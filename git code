$ git commit -a -m "dsdf"

Your co-worker is back, looking sheepish. "Never mind the badgers ad. The client's legal department said that was a liability risk."
 You'll need to remove the most recent commit, and all its changes.

$ git reset --hard HEAD^

//------------------------------------

Oh well, at least you have the site started. Your Example Labs co-worker got you the remote address for the shared repo: git@example.com:example/petshop.git.
 Add that address as the origin repo
 
 $ git remote add origin git@example.com:example/petshop.git

 //------------------------------------
 
 Done for the day! Send your committed work to "origin". Make sure you use the -u option so origin will be the default destination 
 in the future.
 
 $ git push -u origin master
